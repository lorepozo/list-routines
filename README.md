# list-routines

This is an interactive dataset for program learning. The routines in this
dataset take as input a number or a list of numbers, and the output is
either a Boolean, number, or list of numbers.

```
INPUT:   Num | List<Num>
OUTPUT:  Bool | Num | List<Num>
ROUTINE: INPUT => OUTPUT
```

This dataset is in the form of a **REPL** and a **CLI** which can export
samples of the dataset. It is currently highly experimental and subject to
significant change.
